# I think I have not fully understood what a embedding is? At the first place: Do calculate this on single words or on several words at once? How does chunking get into this? Is a window size normally applied?

An **embedding** is a way to represent text—such as words, sentences, or documents—as vectors of numbers, capturing the meaning and relationships between them in a format that can be used by machine learning models[^1_1][^1_4][^1_6]. Here’s how embeddings relate to your specific questions:

**1. Are embeddings calculated on single words or on several words at once?**

- **Embeddings can be calculated for both single words and multiple words**, depending on the approach and the downstream use:
  + **Word embeddings** (like Word2Vec or GloVe) map individual words to vectors[^1_4][^1_5].
  + **Sentence or paragraph embeddings** map entire sentences, paragraphs, or documents to a single vector, capturing the overall meaning[^1_1][^1_2].

**2. What is chunking, and how does it come into play?**

- **Chunking** involves splitting large texts into smaller segments, or "chunks" (often by words or tokens), to fit within model or embedding size limits[^1_8]. This is important because **embedding models and vector databases have maximum input lengths**.
- In typical workflows:
  + You *chunk text first*, then generate an embedding for each chunk separately[^1_2][^1_8].
  + This can risk losing context between chunks, especially if important information spans across chunk boundaries[^1_2][^1_10].

> “Chunking is the process of breaking down large text into smaller segments called chunks.”[^1_8]

**3. Is a window size normally applied?**

- **Yes, in classic word embedding models (like Word2Vec or GloVe), a "window size" defines how many words on either side of the target word are considered its "context" for learning word relationships**[^1_5][^1_7][^1_9].
  + **Smaller window sizes** (e.g., 2-5) capture more syntactic (local) relationships.
  + **Larger window sizes** (e.g., 10+) capture more semantic (global) relationships[^1_5][^1_9].

> “The best window size is around 3 to 5 for source English tasks…but for test languages, larger context windows achieve better results.”[^1_5]

- For **document or chunk embeddings**, the "window size" usually refers to the **length of the text being embedded at once** (e.g., 512 or 1024 tokens per chunk)[^1_2][^1_3][^1_8], not the window around a single word.
  + Embedding models like OpenAI’s can embed up to a set number of tokens in a single call (e.g., 8191 tokens)[^1_3]. For longer texts, chunking is necessary.

**In summary**:

- Embeddings can be for single words or multiple words (chunks, sentences, or full documents).
- Chunking is needed to break up text that exceeds embedding model limits and is performed before embedding.
- Context/window size is crucial for word embeddings and also affects chunk size in practical applications[^1_5][^1_8][^1_9].

# Ok, now look at cocoindex, working with (programming) code and the tree-sitter integration with cocoindex. How does that play together? Does tree-setter do the chunking? On what basis? How many embeddings are calculated? And for what?

**CocoIndex** and **Tree-sitter** work together to **intelligently index source code for search, retrieval, and RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) use cases**. Here’s how their integration works, step by step:

### Does Tree-sitter do the chunking? On what basis?

- **Yes, Tree-sitter is used for chunking in CocoIndex.**
- Tree-sitter parses code into an **abstract syntax tree (AST)**, understanding syntax and structure for each supported programming language[^2_1][^2_4].
- **CocoIndex leverages Tree-sitter to split code into semantically meaningful chunks**, such as functions, classes, or logical code blocks, rather than just splitting by lines or characters[^2_1][^2_3].
- **Chunking is thus syntax-aware**: for example, a function in Python or Rust (or other supported languages) will be one chunk, as determined by the AST nodes provided by Tree-sitter[^2_1].

### How many embeddings are calculated and for what?

- **An embedding is calculated for each code chunk**.
- The **process** is:
  + Read code files from the filesystem (e.g., .py, .rs, etc.).
  + Use Tree-sitter to parse the code and split it into chunks based on its syntactic structure[^2_1].
  + **For every chunk**, generate a vector (“embedding”) that captures the semantics of that chunk using a model like SentenceTransformer or another embedder supported by CocoIndex[^2_1][^2_3].
  + Store these embeddings in a vector database, along with metadata (filename, chunk location, raw code)[^2_1].

### What does Tree-sitter provide in this step?

- **Tree-sitter provides a fine-grained, language-aware parse of the code**.
- Chunks correspond to AST nodes, such as function definitions, classes, or other logical blocks, based on queries or rules set by CocoIndex or the user[^2_2][^2_1].
- This enables semantic search and retrieval, because code is chunked and embedded with respect to *meaningful syntactic entities*, not arbitrary splits[^2_1][^2_3].

### Summary Table

| Step | Tool | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Parse code and extract AST | Tree-sitter | Parses code into syntax tree (AST), understanding structure and language details |
| Chunk code into semantic units | Tree-sitter + CocoIndex | Splits code into chunks (e.g., per function/class) based on AST |
| Embed each chunk | CocoIndex | Calculates vector embedding for every chunk (using a specified model) |
| Store in vector database | CocoIndex | Each chunk and its embedding, plus metadata, stored for retrieval/querying |

**In short:**
Tree-sitter enables syntax-aware chunking in CocoIndex. Each semantically meaningful chunk (defined by code structure, not size or lines) becomes a unit for which an embedding is calculated. The number of embeddings equals the number of code chunks produced by Tree-sitter for the given repo or files[^2_1][^2_3]. This structure is foundational for precise code search and RAG applications.

# Is there a way in cocoindex to customize which chunks tree-sitter builds?

Yes, **cocoindex allows customization of how Tree-sitter chunks your code**.

Specifically:

- You can **select which language-specific chunking logic to apply** via the `language` parameter in the `SplitRecursively` function. This leverages Tree-sitter to break code into semantically meaningful chunks, such as functions, classes, or other syntax units, depending on the language and its grammar[^3_1].
- The split can be further **customized with parameters like `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`**, letting you control how large each chunk is and how much context overlaps between adjacent chunks[^3_1].

> ```> file["chunks"] = file["content"].transform( >     cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(), >     language=file["extension"], chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=300 > ) >```

If you need **even finer-grained or customized splitting**, you can define a custom function or pipeline step. Tree-sitter itself is very flexible, and you can write **custom queries or parsing rules** (following its querying DSL) to select exactly which AST nodes (e.g., only `class` definitions, only public methods, etc.) become chunks[^3_4][^3_2]. This would require extending or configuring cocoindex's pipeline to use your custom Tree-sitter queries or chunking function—a feature supported by its composable design[^3_1][^3_5].

> "CocoIndex provides built-in support for code base chunking, with native Tree-sitter support... You can find the documentation for custom function here."[^3_1]

**Summary:**

- **Out-of-the-box:** Chunking is customizable via parameters (`language`, `chunk_size`, `chunk_overlap`).
- **Advanced:** For more control, create custom functions or Tree-sitter queries to define chunk boundaries by code structure (e.g., only certain AST nodes).
- **Docs/Code:** Check cocoindex’s documentation and examples for specific code samples on custom logic[^3_1][^3_9].

Let me know if you want a concrete code snippet or example for fully custom Tree-sitter chunking logic with cocoindex.

# Hm, why overlap? What does does it serve for?

**Overlap** in chunking means that adjacent chunks share a certain portion of their content, rather than being strictly non-overlapping slices. This is an important detail for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), code search, and any scenario where maintaining contextual integrity across boundaries is valuable.

**Why use overlap? What does it serve?**

- **Preserves context at chunk boundaries:** If you split without overlap, content at the end of one chunk and the start of the next might get separated, resulting in the loss of meaning—especially if a key sentence or code logic crosses that boundary. Overlapping ensures that this boundary content appears in both chunks, so semantic continuity is maintained[^4_1][^4_2][^4_4].
- **Prevents loss of critical information:** For both text and code, important information is often not neatly aligned with your chunk size. Overlap mitigates the risk of queries missing relevant information that happens to fall on a chunk edge[^4_2][^4_3][^4_4].
- **Improves retrieval performance:** In search or RAG, having overlapping regions increases the chances that a user query will hit a relevant chunk—even if the snippet of interest lies near a chunk’s start or end[^4_1][^4_2][^4_3].

> "Overlap between chunks ensures that information at the boundaries is not lost or contextually isolated. This overlapping area can help in creating a more seamless integration of retrieved information." [^4_1]

> "If you chunk with significant overlap you won't 'lose' information due to splitting." [^4_2]

**How much overlap?**

- Best practices suggest an overlap of about **10–20% of the chunk size**, but the exact number depends on your use case, content type, and resource constraints[^4_1][^4_3].
- More overlap increases context retention and recall but also causes redundancy and higher computational/storage costs[^4_1][^4_3].

In summary, **overlap in chunking is to ensure continuity of context across adjacent chunks**, making retrieval more robust and answers more accurate—especially where important content doesn’t align perfectly with your chosen chunk boundaries[^4_1][^4_2][^4_3][^4_4][^4_6].

# Well, I have added support for Haskell (there is a tree-sitter parser for that, but it is not in the main distribution) like this

            file["chunks"] = file["content"].transform(
                cocoindex.functions.SplitRecursively(
                    custom_languages=CUSTOM_LANGUAGES
                ),
                language=file["language"],
                chunk_size=file["chunking_params"]["chunk_size"],
                min_chunk_size=file["chunking_params"]["min_chunk_size"],
                chunk_overlap=file["chunking_params"]["chunk_overlap"],
                )
    CUSTOM_LANGUAGES = [
cocoindex.functions.CustomLanguageSpec(
language_name="Dockerfile",
aliases=[".dockerfile"],
separators_regex=[r"\n\n+",
r"\n(FROM|RUN|COPY|ADD|EXPOSE|ENV|CMD|ENTRYPOINT)", r"\n"]  \# Remove (?=...)
),
\# Haskell - using our custom tree-sitter parser
cocoindex.functions.CustomLanguageSpec(
language_name="Haskell",
aliases=[".hs", ".lhs"],
separators_regex=_haskell_tree_sitter.get_haskell_separators()
),
]

Hence for me it looks like I'm using only a regex for chunking. I think there must be a better way to integrate with tree-sitter-haskell. Do you have some suggestions? Code?

You’re right that the code you posted is effectively using a **regular-expression-based chunking** for Haskell (via the `separators_regex` parameter)—which does not leverage Tree-sitter’s rich syntactic structure. To take full advantage of **tree-sitter-haskell**’s parsing capabilities, you should use the actual **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes** generated by the parser to drive chunking, so your chunks naturally align with Haskell functions, classes, type definitions, etc.[^5_1][^5_3][^5_7]

### Why Move Beyond Regex?

- **Regex is unaware of language syntax.** It will miss or mishandle nested or multiline constructs, comments, blocks, or advanced Haskell features that only the parser "sees."
- **Tree-sitter produces a parse tree**, so you can select chunks by iterating its nodes and choose node types that make sense as chunk boundaries—like `function`, `type_declaration`, or `class`.

### How to Integrate tree-sitter-haskell with CocoIndex for AST Chunking

#### 1. **Load the Tree-sitter-Haskell Parser**

You need to ensure that your programming environment can dynamically load the Haskell grammar (often a `.so` for C, `.dylib` or `.dll` for other platforms, or `.node`), as well as the appropriate bindings for your host language (Python/Rust/Node, etc.)[^5_1][^5_3].

#### 2. **Parse Source and Traverse AST**

- Use the bindings (e.g., [`tree_sitter` Python bindings](https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter)) to parse your source:

```python
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Build and load your custom tree-sitter-haskell.so
Language.build_library(
  'build/my-languages.so',
  ['tree-sitter-haskell']
)
HASKEll_LANGUAGE = Language('build/my-languages.so', 'haskell')

parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(HASKELL_LANGUAGE)
tree = parser.parse(haskell_code.encode())
root_node = tree.root_node
```

- Define a function to **extract semantic units** (chunks): walk the `root_node` to find function/type/class nodes. You may need to consult the `node-types.json` in the Haskell grammar repo to get the exact node names.[^5_1][^5_3]

```python
def extract_haskell_chunks(tree, code_bytes):
    # Example: get all 'function' and 'type_declaration' nodes
    chunks = []
    cursor = tree.walk()
    stack = [cursor.node]
    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node.type in ('function', 'type_declaration'):
            snippet = code_bytes[node.start_byte:node.end_byte].decode()
            chunks.append(snippet)
        # Add children to stack
        stack.extend(node.children)
    return chunks
```

#### 3. **Integrate with cocoindex**

- Instead of using a `CustomLanguageSpec` with only regex, provide a **custom chunking function** that calls this AST-driven logic for Haskell files.
- Cocoindex expects chunking to return a list of (code, metadata) for each chunk.

#### 4. **Practical Example Outline**

```python
# Pseudocode for custom chunker with tree-sitter-haskell and cocoindex

def haskell_chunker(file):
    code = file['content']
    # Parse and extract chunks using AST logic...
    chunks = extract_haskell_chunks(tree, code.encode())
    return chunks
```

Then, register your `haskell_chunker` in Cocoindex for `.hs`/`.lhs` files.

### Key Points

- **tree-sitter-haskell** gives you a full structural parse of Haskell source, supporting precise, semantically meaningful chunks[^5_3][^5_5][^5_1].
- You can and should use this to extract chunks like functions, types, classes, instance declarations, modules, etc., as subtrees—not just by newlines or regex[^5_3].
- Typical Cocoindex integration uses Python, so using `tree-sitter` Python bindings along with your custom parser binary is highly recommended.

> For a robust implementation, inspect the [node-types.json](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell/blob/master/src/node-types.json) in the Haskell grammar repository to identify which node types to chunk on, and, if needed, customize further based on your domain code importance or size constraints[^5_1].

#### Resources to Guide Implementation

- [tree-sitter-haskell node-types.json](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-haskell/blob/master/src/node-types.json)[^5_1]
- [Python bindings for Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/py-tree-sitter)[^5_4]
- See [Docs.rs for tree-sitter-haskell usage patterns](https://docs.rs/tree-sitter-haskell)[^5_3]

**Summary:**
For language- and syntax-aware chunking in Cocoindex, integrate Tree-sitter-Haskell via proper AST traversal, not just regex. This provides **reliable, meaningful splitting** for code search and embeddings in Haskell projects.

# In Haskell top level functions are often composed of (locally defined) functions. In this case, is it beneficial to have an embedding for top-level but also embedding for the local functions? In this case there embeddings would overlap

It can **be beneficial to have embeddings for both the top-level function and its locally defined (nested) functions in Haskell code**—even though this means their embeddings will necessarily overlap in content and context.

Here’s why:

- **Top-level functions represent the public interface or entry points** of your code, and their behavior is often defined *not just by their code,* but also by the logic in any nested local functions within their scope.
- **Local (nested) functions encapsulate specific “sub-tasks” or logic** that support the overall operation of the top-level function. In Haskell, it’s idiomatic to use many local functions for clarity and encapsulation, especially when using `where` and `let/in` clauses[^6_3].

When performing code chunking and embedding:

- **Embedding only at the top level risks losing granularity.** If you retrieve or summarize code based only on top-level functions, you may miss the intent or semantics of critical sub-logic implemented in nested functions.
- **Embedding only the local functions loses the relation to their context.** Their meaning might not be clear without the larger top-level frame that uses them.

**Overlapping embeddings** (chunks containing both top-level and local/nested functions, or local functions included in both their own embedding and as part of a parent’s embedding) is a common and sometimes necessary technique for:

- *Preserving context*—a chunk containing a local function in isolation might be ambiguous, but in the context of its top-level parent it’s clearer.
- *Improving code search and retrieval*—queries may match on the interface, the implementation, or nested logic.
- *Reducing “lost” information at chunk boundaries*—much like text overlap, overlapping code embeddings help bridge boundary issues.

**Best practice (for Haskell and languages with local functions):**

- **Embed the entire top-level function (including its local/nested definitions).**
- **Optionally embed local/nested functions as separate chunks** if they are complex enough to be useful as standalone retrieval units.
- **Accept or even favor some overlap** in embeddings, as it ensures both broad and fine-grained retrieval is possible.

This approach aligns with how retrieval-augmented generation and semantic code search are usually structured in systems designed to understand code semantics—not just literal text[^6_3].

# If you’d like advice on how to design AST-based chunking for this goal, or examples with Tree-sitter. This would be interesting. In addition, if I've got an AST, you have also some metadata about the code. E.g. you have the function name, and if its globally visible. (Or with Java you've got the method name and the class name.)

Is there a way to incooperate this metadata with cocoindex?

You can **absolutely design AST-based chunking to both reflect code structure and capture useful metadata**—and, with the right pipeline, pass that rich metadata directly into **cocoindex** or similar code search/indexing systems. Here’s how to approach this:

### **1. AST-Based Chunking: Best Practices**

- **Traverse the AST** (using tree-sitter or a similar parser), selecting nodes that map to logical retrieval/reasoning units for your language:
  + For **Haskell**, top-level `function_declaration`, `type_declaration`, and perhaps significant nested/local function blocks.
  + For **Java**, `class_declaration`, and each `method_declaration` within.
- **For each chunk:**
  + **Extract code text** corresponding to the AST node’s span.
  + **Extract metadata** such as:
    - Function/method/type/class name
    - Its parent context (e.g. enclosing class/module, if any)
    - Visibility (public, private, etc.—for languages that distinguish this)
    - File path, line/column range, and potentially docstrings/comments.

**Both AST node and its context should be reflected in the chunk’s metadata.**

### **2. Incorporating Metadata into cocoindex**

Most modern chunkers and embedding pipelines—including cocoindex and tools like [ASTChunk](https://github.com/yilinjz/astchunk)[^7_1]—**allow attaching arbitrary metadata to each chunk**.

From the ASTChunk project (which uses tree-sitter for chunking):

```python
# Each chunk contains content and metadata
for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
    print(f"[Chunk {i+1}]")
    print(f"{chunk['content']}")
    print(f"Metadata: {chunk['metadata']}")
```

- The `metadata` dict can include function names, class names, visibility, file path, and more[^7_1].

**In cocoindex,** when creating or ingesting chunks, you can pass a metadata dictionary with each chunk. When you create an embedding for a chunk, attach its metadata to that vector in your vector store. During retrieval, this metadata enhances filtering, display, and context for downstream tasks.

### **3. Example: AST-Based Chunking with Metadata (Python, Pseudocode)**

Suppose you use Python and tree-sitter:

```python
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

def chunk_ast_with_metadata(code_bytes, parser, language):
    # Parse code
    tree = parser.parse(code_bytes)
    root = tree.root_node

    chunks = []
    for node in walk_nodes(root):
        if is_interest_node(node, language):  # e.g., 'function_declaration'
            content = code_bytes[node.start_byte:node.end_byte].decode()
            metadata = {
                "name": extract_function_name(node, code_bytes),
                "type": node.type,
                "start_line": node.start_point[^7_0],
                "end_line": node.end_point[^7_0],
                # add visibility/parent context here
            }
            chunks.append({"content": content, "metadata": metadata})
    return chunks
```

- This structure is compatible with cocoindex’s chunk ingestion.

### **4. Why Attach Metadata?**

- **Improved Retrieval:** Enables searching by function/method/class name, type, or visibility, not just content matching.
- **Display:** When showing a code chunk, you can present its name, parent context, and definition location.
- **Smart Filtering:** E.g., search only public functions, or only methods within a specific class, or only functions in a certain file.

### **5. Existing Tools/Configs**

- Tools like [ASTChunk][^7_1] natively support customizing metadata fields with a `metadata_template`, repo-level metadata, and chunk-specific metadata options.
- Set or extend these to include exactly what you need:

```python
configs = {
  ...
  "metadata_template": "default", # Can be customized
  "repo_level_metadata": {"repo": "my-repo", "filepath": file_path},
}
```

**Summary:**

- Use the AST (from tree-sitter) to select sensible code units to chunk.
- Extract and pass relevant metadata with every chunk.
- Cocoindex (and similar systems) can index both the code and its metadata; you can adjust what to store, retrieve, and display accordingly[^7_1].
- This pattern works equally well for Haskell, Java, Python, and other supported languages.

Let me know if you’d like a sample implementation tailored to a specific language and pipeline, or further details about configuring metadata ingestion in cocoindex!

# Let me know if you’d like a sample implementation tailored to a specific language and pipeline, or further details about configuring metadata ingestion in cocoindex! Yes, go on

Here’s a **sample implementation** that demonstrates how to perform **AST-based chunking of code and include rich metadata with CocoIndex**—tailored for a language like Haskell, Java, or Python. This example uses the CocoIndex pipeline and assumes you have an AST parser (e.g., Tree-sitter) that can be called from Python.

### **Key Steps**

1. **Parse Source Code:** Generate the AST and select nodes (functions, classes, etc.).
2. **Extract Chunks and Metadata:** For each relevant AST node, extract code and metadata (e.g., function name, type, parent context, visibility).
3. **Integrate with CocoIndex:** Attach the extracted code and metadata as fields to each chunk and process them through the rest of the indexing pipeline.

### **Sample Implementation**

```python
# Import CocoIndex (and your AST parser, e.g., tree_sitter)
import cocoindex
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Load your language grammar, e.g., for Haskell or Java
HASKELL_LANGUAGE = Language("build/my-languages.so", "haskell")
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(HASKELL_LANGUAGE)

def extract_haskell_chunks_with_metadata(code_str):
    code_bytes = code_str.encode("utf-8")
    tree = parser.parse(code_bytes)
    root = tree.root_node
    chunks = []
    # Example logic: Select all function_declaration nodes

### **How It Works**

- Each chunk is **not just code text**: it’s accompanied by a metadata dictionary.
- **You can add any metadata**: function name, class, parent module, start/end lines, visibility, etc.—whatever you extract from the AST.
- This metadata is **stored alongside the embedding and chunk** in your vector database (e.g., Postgres with pgvector or Qdrant[^8_2]).
- At **query time**, you can use this metadata for filtering, better result display, or context-aware search.

### **Querying**

You can now query your index and retrieve both the **matched code chunk and its associated metadata** (function name, location, etc.), and use them to assemble rich responses.

### **Summary of Integration Points**

- Use your AST parser to extract **semantic units** and their metadata.
- In your CocoIndex pipeline, transform file content into a list of chunk dictionaries with `"text"` and `"meta"`.
- As you collect and export your data, **unpack metadata fields** for storage and retrieval.
- **No adjustment to CocoIndex’s core logic is needed**—it’s designed to accept and store arbitrary fields[^8_1][^8_2].

Let me know if you want a sample for Java, or how to adapt filtering/query logic to use the metadata!

# How do embedding model fit to this picture? Perhaps something like CodeBERT could improve the RAG as well. Where to put it in cocoindex? What about SentenceTransformer and/or Voyage AI? Can embeddings be combined?

**Embedding models** are the core component that transforms each code chunk (from the chunking/AST parsing pipeline) into a high-dimensional vector that captures its semantics. These vectors are then stored in a vector database, and power retrieval for RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), code search, and reasoning tasks.

### **Where do embedding models fit in the CocoIndex pipeline?**

- **After chunking (AST + metadata):**
  + Each code chunk (often with associated metadata) is passed into the embedding model.
- **Model selection:**
  + You can plug in a wide range of models—simple ones like `SentenceTransformer`, or advanced, domain-specific models such as **CodeBERT** (and its variants, e.g., GraphCodeBERT, UniXcoder), or high-performers like **Voyage AI**.
- **The embedding model generates the vector, which is saved in the index alongside metadata and the original code.**

In CocoIndex, **the embedding step is modular**:
You specify which embedding model to use in the pipeline—just after chunking and before writing to your vector store.

```python
chunk["embedding"] = chunk["text"].transform(
    cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(
        model="sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"
    )
)
```

Replace the above with a `CodeBERT`-based embedder or other code-optimized models.

### **Model Choices \& RAG Performance**

- **CodeBERT** and other code-specific transformer models have been shown to outperform generic models for semantic code search, code-to-text, and code classification, because they are pre-trained on code corpora and can understand code structure, variable relationships, and API semantics much better than generic text models[^9_1][^9_2][^9_3][^9_4][^9_10].
- **RAG improvement:** Using models like CodeBERT or Voyage AI for embedding generation leads to more relevant chunk retrievals, especially for complex queries involving code logic or natural language descriptions[^9_1][^9_10].
- **Model flexibility:** CocoIndex supports both Huggingface (`transformers`) models and API-based providers, so you can swap in CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, UnixCoder, or services like Voyage AI[^9_10][^9_11].

### **Combining Multiple Embeddings**

- You **can compute multiple embeddings for each chunk** (e.g., one with CodeBERT, one with SentenceTransformer, one with Voyage AI).
- The vectors can be **stored as separate fields** in your index.
- At query time, you:
  + Can select which embedding to use for retrieval (e.g., only CodeBERT for code searches, SentenceTransformer for descriptions), OR
  + Combine similarity scores from multiple embeddings (e.g., via score fusion or ensemble) to rank results[^9_10].

*Example in CocoIndex:*

```python
chunk["embedding_codebert"] = chunk["text"].transform(
    cocoindex.functions.HuggingfaceEmbed(model="microsoft/codebert-base")
)
chunk["embedding_st"] = chunk["text"].transform(
    cocoindex.functions.SentenceTransformerEmbed(model="all-mpnet-base-v2")
)
```

Store both, then at retrieval time, choose which one (or both) to use.

### **Summary Table**

| Step | What Happens | Where the Embedding Model Fits |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Chunking | Code is chunked, AST and metadata extracted |  |
| Embedding | Each chunk passes through model (e.g., CodeBERT) | **Here: Choose model** |
| Storage | Embedding + code + metadata saved in vector database |  |
| Retrieval / RAG | Queries embedded via same model; similarity search done | Must match embedding reference |

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Plug embedding models into CocoIndex at the embedding step**—after chunking with AST/Tree-sitter, before storage.
- Use **CodeBERT** or similar models for code-centric use cases for better results.
- You can **generate and use multiple embeddings per chunk** if you want to ensemble or allow user choice at retrieval time.
- All embedding vectors are associated with your rich metadata, which remains queryable and filterable.

# I guess I could also use more than one index - and use different embeddings for each

Yes, you can use more than one index and use different embeddings for each—this is a common pattern in advanced search and retrieval systems, including for code and RAG workflows.

**How does this work in practice?**

- Each index can be built using a different embedding model (e.g., one index uses CodeBERT for code understanding, another uses a general-purpose SentenceTransformer, and another might use Voyage AI’s API).
- Each index may focus on a different aspect or "view": for example, code semantics, language-agnostic summary, docstrings, or natural language descriptions.

**Querying multiple indexes:**

- You can submit queries to multiple indexes simultaneously (sometimes called *multi-index search* or *federated search*) and then display, merge, or rank the results as you see fit[^10_1][^10_2][^10_3][^10_4].
- Each index returns results scored according to its own model/embedding, and you can choose to present results from each separately, or post-process and merge results, depending on your needs[^10_1][^10_2].

**In the context of cocoindex and code search:**

- You would configure cocoindex to build each index with its own embedding pipeline—this is typically done by running your chunking and embedding steps separately for each model (e.g., one pass with CodeBERT, another with a SentenceTransformer), then storing the results in different named collections (indexes) in your vector database[^10_10][^10_11].
- At query time, you can query both or all indexes, and either present results by source, or combine scores for a unified ranking, depending on your logic and UX preferences[^10_1][^10_2].

**Advantages:**

- **Each embedding/model has unique strengths**—CodeBERT is better for code structure and semantics, while general language models might be more robust for docstrings and user queries.
- Having separate indexes lets you leverage the best of each model and use them selectively based on the type of query or retrieval scenario.

**Example usage in cocoindex (conceptual steps):**

- Index 1: Chunks + CodeBERT embeddings → stored in `codebert_code_chunks`
- Index 2: Same chunks or different view + SentenceTransformer embeddings → stored in `st_code_chunks`
- Query both indexes for every search, or route queries to the appropriate index (e.g., code analysis queries to CodeBERT index; documentation queries to SentenceTransformer index)

**Bottom line:**
Yes, using multiple indexes—with different embeddings/model strategies for each—is both possible and beneficial. This approach is supported in cocoindex and most modern vector databases, and lets you optimize retrieval quality and flexibility for a range of use cases[^10_1][^10_2][^10_3][^10_4].

# with cocoindex life updates you recognise file changes. you need to add the new embeddings. but you also have to delete the old ones. is both automatically?

CocoIndex is designed for **automatic incremental processing** when files change. This includes detecting updates, additions, or deletions in your source data and keeping your index (including embeddings) synchronized—**both adding new embeddings and removing obsolete ones is handled by CocoIndex** when you enable its live update or incremental processing features[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5][^11_6].

### How does it work?

- **Change Detection:** CocoIndex watches your data source (local files, cloud, etc.) and compares the current state to the previous state using mechanisms like file metadata (modification time), full scans, or even real-time push notifications for some cloud sources[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5][^11_6].
- **Automatic Updates:** When a file is added or modified, CocoIndex detects the change and *automatically* recomputes all relevant derived data, including embeddings for new or updated chunks[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5].
- **Automatic Deletion:** When a file is deleted or renamed, CocoIndex recognizes this and will *automatically remove any derived data*—such as outdated embeddings—from the index[^11_2][^11_3][^11_5][^11_6].

> "CocoIndex continuously watches source changes and keeps derived data in sync, with low latency and minimal performance overhead... After the change is detected, CocoIndex will use its incremental processing mechanism to update the target data"[^11_2].

> "CocoIndex create and maintain indexes while keeping them up to date with source changes through minimal reprocessing... This ensures low latency between source and index updates while minimizing computational costs."[^11_5]

**In summary:**
You do not need to manage deletion of old embeddings or addition of new ones manually—CocoIndex’s incremental or live update mode takes care of both when source files are changed, added, or removed[^11_1][^11_2][^11_5][^11_6].

If you activate live/incremental update mode (such as with the `-L` flag or `FlowLiveUpdater`), this synchronization is continuous and automatic. No additional user intervention is required for deletion or insertion of embeddings after file changes.

## Code Embedding Models: Options and Features

Code embedding models form the backbone of semantic code search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), code similarity, and code analytics. They vary by underlying architecture, deployment approach (local or SaaS/API), GPU acceleration, and unique traits that address developer needs.

### Key Implementations \& Special Properties

Here is a comparative overview of prominent code embedding models and their distinguishing properties[^12_1][^12_2][^12_3]:

| Name | Type | GPU Acceleration | Deployment | Special Properties | Access |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

| CodeBERT | Code-specific | Yes (PyTorch CUDA/local) | Local/cloud | Pre-trained for code, good for code semantics, HuggingFace model | HuggingFace (local or cloud) |
| Voyage AI | Code-specific | Yes (API/local) | SaaS API or local | High accuracy, large context, flexible quantization | Voyage API |
| EMBD | General-purpose | Yes (client-side GPU) | Local (browser/Electron) | Cross-platform, fast in-browser embeddings | Open source (client-side) |

### Options Explained

- **Local/Open-Source Models**: Nomic Embed Code, CodeSage, CodeRankEmbed, SentenceTransformer, CodeBERT, and EMBD can be run on your own hardware, usually with GPU acceleration via PyTorch or ONNX. This maximizes privacy and allows offline or on-prem deployment.
- **SaaS/API Models**: OpenAI, VoyageCode3, and Jina provide APIs for embedding generation. Ideal for quick integration and scalability; GPU is handled by the provider.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Most modern models support GPU acceleration for rapid embeddings—whether locally (e.g., PyTorch CUDA for SentenceTransformers, Nomic, CodeSage, CodeRankEmbed) or via the cloud/API providers.
- **Special Properties**:
  + Some like VoyageCode3 and CodeSage support embedding quantization for storage and inference efficiency.
  + CodeBERT and Code-specific models are pretrained on code corpora, improving understanding of structure and semantics.
  + EMBD enables in-browser, fast client-side embedding, leveraging WebGPU for privacy and no-server scenarios.
  + Jina and Nomic models boast extensive programming language support.

### Takeaways

- **For privacy and full control**: Open source models (Nomic, CodeSage, SentenceTransformer, CodeBERT) allow you to run everything locally with GPU acceleration.
- **For simplicity and scale**: SaaS offerings (OpenAI, Voyage, Jina) let you embed via API, offloading hardware requirements.
- **Hybrid approaches**: Some APIs (like Jina, Voyage) also offer options to download and run models locally if needed[^12_1][^12_2][^12_3].

**Choose based on deployment needs (local vs. SaaS), languages covered, and whether privacy or ease of use is more important for your use case.**

# coming back to metadata. in a chunk there might be metadata that is specific for only a part of the chunk. could that be tackled as well?

**Yes, it is possible to address metadata that is specific only to a part of a chunk, but there are important limitations and design choices to consider.**

### Key Considerations

- **Standard metadata approaches associate metadata with entire chunks, not substrings.** This is the common practice in vector databases and code/text retrieval systems. Each chunk (“document”) has an associated metadata dictionary[^13_5][^13_9].
- **If metadata granularity is needed for substrings within a chunk**, the typical strategies are:
  + **Create smaller, more fine-grained chunks:** Use the AST or document structure to split your data into the smallest meaningful “atomic” units (e.g., individual functions, classes, sections), so that each unit’s metadata only applies to its exact content[^13_6].
  + **Include inner-metadata as in-band markers:** You can annotate sections of the text (e.g., comments or special tokens) with metadata references, but this makes downstream usage more complex.
  + **Record a list of metadata spans for a chunk:** Store metadata as a list of ({start, end}, metadata) tuples for each chunk, so you know where within the chunk specific metadata applies; however, most current vector search systems don’t natively support this—extra logic is needed in your application layer.

### Practical Approaches

1. **Chunk at the smallest unit with distinct metadata.**
    + If part A has metadata X and part B in the same chunk has metadata Y, split into two chunks if possible.
    + Use ASTs or document partitioners for accurate splitting[^13_6].
2. **Attach a metadata map or list to the chunk (custom solution).**
    + In your metadata, store a list of sub-regions with their own metadata:

```json
{
  "chunk": "<code for chunk>",
  "metadata": {
    "chunk_level": {"file": "foo.hs", "language": "Haskell"},
    "sub_metadata": [
      {"start": 10, "end": 50, "type": "pattern match", "owner": "local function"},
      {"start": 51, "end": 100, "type": "guard", "owner": "outer function"}
    ]
  }
}
```

    - Retrieval and downstream applications must understand and use this metadata structure.
3. **Pipeline composition:**
    - Initial chunking can create fine-grained chunks with specific metadata.
    - Optionally, later merge smaller chunks for efficiency, combining metadata appropriately.
4. **Use hierarchical indexing:**
    - Some modern systems (often outside mainstream vector dbs, or with custom frameworks) allow for nested or hierarchical documents, where queries can drill into sub-units and retrieve metadata for both the parent chunk and child spans.

### Community and Tooling Realities

- Current mainstream text and code chunking/embedding frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, CocoIndex, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.) generally work on a **per-chunk metadata model**[^13_5][^13_9].
- More granular “span-level” metadata must be tracked and handled by your own code—often by adjusting chunking granularity or storing custom metadata lists as above.

### Summary

- The **best-practice** is to chunk as finely as possible, so each piece has accurate metadata.
- If not possible or efficient, store span-specific metadata within your chunk’s metadata, and use application-side logic to interpret it.
- Mainstream vector search engines do **not natively support multi-span metadata within a single chunk**—but custom application logic can compensate.

Let me know if you want concrete code examples for storing and retrieving span-level metadata in this way.

# newest kid on the block are GraphRAG. hence it is possible to additionally stored the AST. And cocoindex has support for graph DBs. how to incorporate GraphRAG with cocoindex. should I store the complete AST or the chunked AST? how to retrieve that extra information?

GraphRAG combines retrieval with graph-based reasoning by structuring documents (or code) as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph, which can then be queried in a more semantically rich way. CocoIndex supports graph DB integrations (like Kuzu or Neo4j), making it a great fit for GraphRAG-style pipelines.

### How to incorporate GraphRAG with CocoIndex

1. **Chunking \& AST parsing**
You start by chunking your codebase or documents (e.g., using Tree-sitter for code). Each chunk corresponds to a semantic unit (function, class, paragraph, etc.).
2. **Building the graph**
Instead of just embedding and indexing chunks as isolated vectors, **extract entities and relations from the chunks’ AST or parsed content**. For code, these can be function calls, inheritance, variable usage, module imports, etc.
This step turns your codebase into a **graph of nodes (chunks, functions, types, modules) connected by edges representing code relationships**.
3. **Store the graph in a graph database**
CocoIndex supports exporting to graph DBs like Kuzu or Neo4j. Instead of only storing vectors, you store:
    + Nodes: the chunks or code elements with embeddings and metadata
    + Edges: relations from AST or static analysis (dependencies, calls, references)
4. **Complete vs chunked AST storage**
    + **Storing the complete AST for a large code base is often impractical**—very big, hard to query directly, and costly to embed as a whole.
    + **Better to store the chunked AST elements** (AST subtrees corresponding to the chunks). Each chunk remains an atomic node with metadata and embeddings, while relations between them encode AST connections.
    + This allows efficient retrieval and graph traversal of semantic units.
5. **Querying GraphRAG with CocoIndex**
    + You query the vector search on chunk embeddings to find relevant nodes.
    + Use the graph DB’s traversal capabilities to explore related nodes (e.g., find callers, dependencies).
    + Summaries or synthesis of retrieved subgraphs can be generated by LLMs for final answers.

### Summary: Implementation flow with CocoIndex + GraphRAG

| Step | Description | CocoIndex Support/How |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Chunk \& embed code | Parse code with Tree-sitter, chunk into semantic units | Use Tree-sitter chunking + embedding pipeline |
| Extract AST relations | Identify edges: calls, inheritance, imports, dependencies | Use custom pipeline step or LLM relation extraction |
| Create graph DB nodes | Store each chunk as a node with embeddings and metadata | Export to Kuzu or Neo4j graph DB via CocoIndex connectors |
| Create graph edges | Store relationships between nodes as edges | Write edges with source, target, relationship type |
| Query graph + vectors | Combine vector similarity with graph traversal for retrieval | Use CocoIndex vector search + graph query APIs to retrieve subgraphs |
| Summarize \& answer | Use LLM on retrieved subgraph nodes and context for answers | Connect retrieved subgraph text for final prompt generation |

### Practical tips

- **Chunk your AST meaningfully** so each chunk/node corresponds to a coherent semantic code unit.
- **Extract only relevant AST edges** to keep the graph efficient and insightful (e.g., only function calls, type hierarchies).
- **Use CocoIndex’s graph DB support** (e.g., Kuzu) for storage and fast traversal combined with vector similarity search.
- **Leverage LlamaIndex or LangChain GraphRAG cookbooks** ([ref [^14_1]]), adapting their graph construction and query patterns with the chunked AST data you generate through CocoIndex.

### Retrieving extra AST info during query

- When you query by embedding similarity and get back chunk nodes, use the graph edges to:
  + Fetch related nodes (callers, callees, overrides).
  + Retrieve metadata like full function signatures, types, or source locations.
- This allows graph-aware retrieval and helps generate richer, holistic answers than isolated chunk retrieval.

### In short

- **Store chunked AST nodes as graph nodes, not the full huge monolithic AST.**
- **Store AST-derived relations as edges.**
- **Index embeddings on chunks for vector similarity.**
- **Use graph DB queries to traverse and enrich retrieval.**
- **Use an LLM to summarize or generate an answer from the retrieved graph substructure.**

This approach leverages the best of CocoIndex’s incremental chunking, embedding, and graph DB export to build a scalable GraphRAG pipeline over code or documents.

Let me know if you want example code snippets or a sample pipeline config for this!

# hence you vote for transforming the AST into a relation graph. are there open source libs in this field? supporting tree sitter?

Transforming the AST into a relation graph is indeed a modern and powerful approach for GraphRAG, code understanding, and advanced retrieval—and there's active open source development in this area, with growing support for integrating ASTs with graph databases.

### Open Source Libraries for AST to Relation Graphs

Here are several notable projects that support (or can be adapted to) this approach. Some are language-specific, and tree-sitter integration is often possible where the output format (AST) is compatible.

| Library | AST Input/Language | Graph DB/Format | Description / Notes | Tree-sitter Support |

Also, Google \& CMU’s recent project for Python produces **graph representations of code for ML**—accepting Python source, code strings, or ASTs, and converting them for graph-based learning and analysis [^15_9].

### Remarks on Tree-sitter Integration

- **Tree-sitter outputs a standard AST format** in many languages (usually via S-expressions or JSON). Libraries like GraphAST or your own pipeline can convert this directly into nodes and edge lists for your target graph.
- **Customization is easy:** Once you have the AST from tree-sitter, you can define:
  + **Node types:** functions, classes, variables, etc.
  + **Edge types:** function calls, inheritance, data flow, etc.
- **Storing in graph DB:** Use Neo4j, Kuzu, or similar graph DBs for fast relation-based queries, which is what CocoIndex supports natively.

### Should you store the complete AST or the chunked AST?

- **Chunked AST is usually better.**
Storing the complete AST for an entire codebase can get unwieldy and makes querying for specific semantic units difficult.
- **Best practice:**
  + Chunk code into meaningful units (functions, classes, modules).
  + Store the subtree of the AST for each chunk as a node in your graph.
  + Encode inter-chunk (and intra-chunk, if needed) relations as edges.

This makes retrieval, graph traversal, and LLM synthesis modular, efficient, and compatible with RAG workflows.

### Retrieving extra AST (graph) info

- When you retrieve by similarity (vector search) or through the graph (e.g., “all callers of this function”), you can:
  + Pull in connected nodes (dependencies, parents, children)
  + Return associated metadata, code snippets, or subtree ASTs
  + Combine graph and vector results for powerful GraphRAG-style LLM prompting

**In summary:**

- Open source projects like ACER, GraphAST, and Graphlr already enable AST-to-graph transformations, and are adaptable to tree-sitter.
- Direct work with tree-sitter AST plus custom import into a graph DB (using one of these libs or your own code) is very feasible.
- Store and query *chunked* AST units as graph nodes, not giant monolithic ASTs.

# is there anything for Haskell?

There is **no out-of-the-box, mainstream open source Haskell tool that transforms Haskell code’s AST (produced by Tree-sitter or GHC) directly into a richly-typed relation graph for GraphRAG**. However, Haskell has strong building blocks that enable this workflow, and several libraries and patterns are highly relevant:

### Options and Building Blocks

#### 1. **AST Representation and Parsing**

- **Tree-sitter-haskell**: Provides concrete AST nodes for Haskell source.
- **GHC API**: Offers the most detailed ASTs but is more complex to work with than Tree-sitter.

#### 2. **Graph Construction and Manipulation**

- **Functional Graph Library (`fgl`)**: Robust and popular for general graph representation and algorithms in Haskell[^16_10][^16_6].
- **Alga**, **Hash-Graph**, and **containers' Data.Graph**: Efficient alternatives for specific graph operations and analyses[^16_6][^16_8][^16_10].
- **pangraph**: For importing/exporting graphs from/to various formats (like DOT, GEXF, etc.) if you want format bridges[^16_4].

#### 3. **Pattern: AST to Graph**

While a “packaged AST-to-GraphRAG for Haskell” isn’t published, the common pattern is:

- **Parse Haskell into an AST**.
- **Traverse the AST**, extracting nodes (functions, types, etc.) and edges (calls, type usage, references).
- **Build a graph** using `fgl` or `Data.Graph`, where:
  + Each node represents an AST element (function, type, module, etc.).
  + Each edge represents a relationship (function call, inheritance, module import).

#### 4. **Relevant Examples**

- **Haskell-Chart-Parser** parses to AST and can produce parse trees, and its chart parsing method adds edges ("chart" is essentially a parse graph)—example of creating a graph from parsed Haskell, adaptable for relation graphs[^16_1].
- **Free Arrow** pattern: For computations, “free arrow” representations can build DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) out of Haskell code, especially for arrow-based workflows; this is not full source code AST but shows that *graph views on code are idiomatic in Haskell*[^16_7].
- **Data.Reify**: Makes it possible to turn explicit sharing Haskell expressions into graph representations that can then be converted to ASTs with sharing preserved. Stack Overflow shows this is used in advanced code analysis workflows[^16_2].

#### 5. **Visualization and Further Processing**

- Use `fgl-visualize` or output DOT/Graphviz files for visualization[^16_10].
- `pangraph` for translation/export between graph formats[^16_4].

### Summary Table of Haskell Libraries \& Patterns

| Purpose | Library/Pattern | Tree-sitter Compatible? | Typical Use |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AST parsing (Haskell source) | tree-sitter-haskell, GHC API | Yes* (for tree-sitter-haskell) | Parse source into AST |
| Graph representation/algorithms | fgl, Alga, Data.Graph, Hash-Graph | Yes (manual) | Store and process graphs |
| Graph export/import/visualization | pangraph, fgl-visualize | Yes (manual) | Export to DOT, import from graph files |
| AST/graph reification | data-reify | Yes (manual) | Turn explicit sharing into DAG/AST hybrid |
| Computational graph from code/arrows | Free Arrow | Not source AST | Arrow-based code visualized/organized as DAG |

\* You must walk and convert tree-sitter ASTs to your graph structure using standard Haskell traversal code.

### Practical Workflow

1. **Parse code with Tree-sitter or GHC API**.
2. **Manually traverse AST**, collecting graph nodes/edges as needed.
3. **Build indexed graphs** with `fgl` or similar.
4. **Export or augment with pangraph** if cross-tool compatibility or visualization needed.

No “push-button” library yet exists, but **all key pieces are robust and available**, and open-source community knowledge (e.g., [Haskell-Chart-Parser][^16_1], [data-reify][^16_2]) provides strong examples.

# is updating the graph also fully automatic in cocoindex?

**Yes, updating the graph is fully automatic in CocoIndex when you enable its incremental processing or live update mode**. Here’s how it works:

- **Continuous change detection:** CocoIndex continuously monitors your source data for changes—additions, modifications, or deletions—using either periodic scans (refresh intervals) or, where available, push-based notifications and recent-changes APIs[^17_5][^17_6].
- **Incremental updating:** When a change is detected in your source (files, documents, or code), CocoIndex **automatically updates all derived data**, which includes vector indexes as well as graph/knowledge graph structures. This means new nodes and relationships are added, updated nodes are modified, and removed nodes/edges are deleted[^17_3][^17_6][^17_7].
- **Schema and structure inference:** CocoIndex automatically manages internal schema and infrastructure (like the graph database schema) based on your data and processing flow, minimizing manual configuration or risk of mismatch[^17_1].
- **Supported graph databases:** This automation covers property graphs in graph databases such as Neo4j or Kuzu, which CocoIndex natively supports[^17_2][^17_3].

After you set up a knowledge graph or property graph index in CocoIndex, **all you need to do is run the pipeline in live/incremental update mode** (such as with `cocoindex update -L` or using the `FlowLiveUpdater` in the Python SDK), and all updates—including graph structure—will stay in sync with your changing source data[^17_5][^17_6]. You do not need to manually update or manage the graph after the initial setup.

> “CocoIndex makes it easy to build and maintain knowledge graphs with continuous source updates... keeping your index up-to-date with minimal latency”[^17_3][^17_5][^17_6].

This automatic updating applies to both standard indexes and knowledge/graph indexes.

# hence, I get the changes from cocoindex, not directly from file?

You **get the changes from cocoindex, not directly from the file**. CocoIndex continuously monitors your source data (such as files or cloud sources), detects any modifications, additions, or deletions, and automatically propagates those changes to your index—including embeddings, property/knowledge graphs, and any other derived data[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_7].

**How it works:**

- CocoIndex **does the file or data monitoring for you**, using either refresh intervals (periodic scans and checksums), source-specific APIs (such as Google Drive recent changes polling), or real-time push notifications (where supported, with more coming soon)[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_5][^18_7].
- Once a change is detected in the source, **CocoIndex triggers its incremental update mechanism**. It figures out precisely which parts of your derived data need to be updated, recomputed, or deleted, and applies those changes efficiently with minimal latency and computation[^18_1][^18_2][^18_3][^18_6][^18_7].
- **You don't need to watch files yourself**—you interact with the target/index managed by CocoIndex, which is always kept in sync with the freshest underlying source data[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4].

> "It continuously captures changes from the source data and updates the target data accordingly. It's long-running and only stops when being aborted explicitly." [^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_7]

> "CocoIndex create and maintain indexes while keeping them up to date with source changes through minimal reprocessing." [^18_3][^18_6]

**Summary:**
You rely on CocoIndex to detect source changes and automatically update your indexes. You only need to query or use the index provided by CocoIndex, which reflects all source file changes in near real-time[^18_1][^18_3][^18_4][^18_7].

# for languages supported by build in tree sitter, is there also build in metadata processing?

For **languages supported by built-in Tree-sitter grammars**, there is **built-in support for extracting certain types of metadata from the syntax tree**, but the **depth and specificity of metadata extraction depend on both the grammar and the query logic** used.

### What’s Built-In?

- **Tree-sitter itself** produces an **abstract syntax tree (AST)** with detailed node information: each node has a type, position (row/column), and relationship to other nodes, which is consistent across supported languages[^19_3][^19_5][^19_8].
- **Node metadata** includes:
  + **Type of node** (e.g., function, class, identifier)
  + **Location** (start/end rows and columns)
  + **Contextual flags** — for example, if a node is named, missing, extra, or an error[^19_6]
  + **Raw text** corresponding to any node
- **Metadata extraction is programmable via queries:**
Tree-sitter’s query system (used in editors and tools) allows you to extract custom metadata. For example, in Neovim, you can write queries that tag nodes and attach key-value metadata via directives like `#set!`[^19_1]:

```scheme
((identifier) @foo (#set! @foo kind "parameter"))
((function_definition) @func (#set! name "myFunction"))
```

When you **run a query**, each matched capture can carry custom metadata—accessed programmatically[^19_1][^19_2].

- **Built-in queries (in editors or tools)**:
Editors like Neovim that integrate Tree-sitter have default queries per language for tasks like highlighting, folding, navigation, etc., and those typically tag code elements with relevant metadata (like scope, kind, etc.)[^19_1][^19_2][^19_5].

### Is there language-specific metadata logic?

- **Yes, but only to the extent defined by the grammar and standard queries:**
  + For example, a Python grammar will distinguish class/function/identifier nodes, but won’t know e.g. which functions are "staticmethods" unless queries or extra logic is provided.
  + Any further metadata (like visibility, scope, documentation, parent class, etc.) must be extracted via tree traversal or custom queries.

### How do you access this in practice?

- Use `iter_captures`, `get_range`, and metadata-aware queries in your tooling (Neovim, or programmatically in Python, Rust, etc.)[^19_1][^19_2].
- For programmatic use, libraries expose node-level metadata (type, location, status flags), and you can extend with custom queries.

### Summary

| Feature | Built-in via Tree-sitter | Language-specific? | Query/Extension Needed? |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Node type \& locations | Yes | Yes (per grammar) | No |
| Error/missing/extra flags | Yes | Yes (universal flags) | No |
| Attribute e.g., visibility | No | Sometimes (depends on grammar) | Often (need custom queries) |
| Custom metadata (e.g., kind) | Yes (via query directives) | As defined in query | Yes |

**In short:**
*Tree-sitter gives you built-in, robust node metadata for all supported languages (types, location, flags). Advanced or semantic metadata—like visibility, decorators, parent classes, etc.—requires custom queries or further processing, but the infrastructure for attaching, extracting, and using such metadata is universal and supported out-of-the-box for all built-in grammars.*[^19_1][^19_2][^19_6]

# can I make use of that within third party tree sitter grammars and parser, i.e. for Haskell?

**Yes, you can use metadata extraction and querying features with third-party Tree-sitter grammars (such as for Haskell) the same way as with built-in grammars.** Here’s how it works and what you need to keep in mind:

### How Tree-sitter Treats Metadata and Grammars

- **Tree-sitter by design is agnostic to the source of the grammar**—whether it’s an “official” grammar or a third-party one for a less common language (like Haskell). Any Tree-sitter-compliant parser produces the same type of AST, with nodes defined by the grammar’s rules[^20_4][^20_8].
- **All grammars (official or third-party) specify nodes and their types**. When you parse code (including Haskell) with a third-party grammar, each AST node has:
  + A node type (e.g., `"function_declaration"`, `"variable"`)
  + Start/end positions
  + Parent/child relationships
  + Any flags (error, missing, etc.)[^20_4][^20_8]

### Metadata Extraction

- **You can programmatically extract “metadata”** like function names, node types, code locations, etc., from *any* AST, since all this information is embedded in the parse tree itself[^20_3][^20_4].
- For advanced or custom metadata (like visibility, decorators, or special attributes), it’s up to you (or third-party tools/queries) to:
  + Identify the correct node types in the third-party grammar
  + Traverse/find the nodes of interest
  + Optionally, run custom Tree-sitter queries (the query system is universal and works equally for third-party grammars as for built-ins)

### Examples \& Getting Started

- Like with built-in grammars, when you use code like:

```python
for node in tree.root_node.children:
    print(node.type, node.start_point, node.end_point)
```

This works whether the grammar is official or third-party—the node metadata is always provided by the parser[^20_5][^20_6].

- **If the third-party grammar provides query files, you can use them directly** for auto-highlighting, symbol extraction, etc. If not, you can write your own, since the query mechanism is always available (used in editors like Nova, Pulsar, Neovim, etc.)[^20_3][^20_2].

### What’s Different for Third-party Grammars?

- **No difference in how Tree-sitter delivers node metadata.**
- **What may differ is the richness and correctness of the grammar:**
  + Some third-party grammars might lack certain structural details or have fewer node types, making metadata extraction less detailed.
  + The community or you may need to improve or extend the grammar for more granular or accurate metadata.

### Haskell Example

- The `tree-sitter-haskell` parser provides AST nodes for Haskell constructs. You can extract function definitions, names, patterns, etc., and attach or use this as metadata in your indexing, just as with Python or JavaScript.
- If you want even richer metadata (e.g., module import graphs, type classes), you may need to traverse the AST more deeply or enrich the grammar/queries.

**In summary:**
*You can fully use metadata extraction, queries, and downstream features with third-party Tree-sitter grammars (like for Haskell)—Tree-sitter’s API and query capabilities apply universally to any compliant grammar, though the detail of metadata you get depends on the grammar’s design and completeness[^20_3][^20_4][^20_5].*

Let me know if you’d like a working Haskell-specific metadata extraction example using Tree-sitter!

# this was meta data extraction. but it has to be stored in vector ( and graph DBs). this is dependant on the used DB. e.g. very different for pgvector and qdrant. this is also done automatically?

**Metadata extraction and storage into vector and graph databases in advanced indexing systems like CocoIndex is, to a large extent, automatic—but is also dependent on both the chosen backend and your configuration/pipeline.**

### How does it work?

#### **1. Extraction \& Attachment**

- When you parse and chunk your code with Tree-sitter (built-in or third party):
  + **Node and chunk metadata** (such as function names, node types, line/column ranges) can be extracted programmatically or via query patterns[^21_2][^21_7].
  + This information is then attached as a metadata dictionary to each chunk or node in your pipeline (e.g., via CocoIndex collectors or chunk objects)[^21_3].

#### **2. Storage in Vector Databases (e.g., pgvector, Qdrant, Pinecone)**

- **Metadata is stored together with each embedding** as a key-value dictionary when uploading to the vector DB, provided the DB supports this (most modern ones do: pgvector, Qdrant, Pinecone, Milvus, etc.)[^21_5][^21_8].
  + For example, each stored vector/document can have fields like: `{embedding: [...], chunk_text: "...", metadata: {"function_name": "...", "start_line": 10, "node_type": "function"}}`.
- **Automatic for mainstream systems**—CocoIndex, LangChain, and LlamaIndex (and others) will, by default, pass any attached metadata from the chunk object to the database as long as the vector DB's schema permits JSON/dictionary fields.
- **Differences across backends:**
  + **pgvector:** Usually stores metadata in a separate JSONB (or hstore) column alongside the vector[^21_5].
  + **Qdrant:** Allows structured payloads per point/vector, which can be queried/filter/searched directly.
  + **Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus:** All have similar models—vector + metadata fields.

#### **3. Graph Database Storage (Neo4j, Kuzu)**

- **Graph nodes and edges can hold arbitrary key-value metadata.**
- CocoIndex’s graph DB support uses a property graph model, so when you export chunked AST nodes or semantic units, you can attach all relevant metadata to the nodes and (optionally) edges.
- The process is similar for both built-in and third-party grammars: Extract metadata when building the graph; it’s included as properties upon graph insertion[^21_3].

#### **4. How “automatic” is this?**

- **CocoIndex and modern frameworks aim to automate this:**
  + If your pipeline is set up (as in the CocoIndex code embedding example[^21_3]), anything you attach to your chunk/collector as metadata is handled for you and pushed downstream into whatever DB is configured.
  + No extra logic is needed to store basic metadata—**it’s included by default** in vector and property graph DB exports.
  + You only need to write custom transformation code if you want more granular or nested metadata, or if your DB schema is nonstandard.

#### **5. Caveats**

- If you want **very large or nested metadata** (like full subtrees or maps), some databases (e.g., classic RDBMS with pgvector) may require careful schema design or limit what can be efficiently queried.
- Custom spanning/offset metadata (e.g., for segments inside a chunk) may require slight code adaptation.

### Summary Table

| Operation | Automatic in CocoIndex? | Notes/Customization |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Chunk/Node metadata extraction | Yes, if pipeline extracts or queries | Use queries or tree traversal to attach |
| Metadata attached to embeddings | Yes, for all supported vector DBs | Stored as JSON/dict with each vector |
| Insert metadata into graph DB | Yes, for property graph DBs | Nodes/edges can have arbitrary properties |
| Degree of automation | Very high, but depends on pipeline | Custom handling for edge-case metadata |

**In practice:**

- **Extract metadata (function names, positions, node types)** from Tree-sitter (any grammar).
- **Attach it to chunks/nodes** in CocoIndex.
- **Store it automatically** along with the embedding in both vector and graph DBs (with backend-specific details abstracted by CocoIndex).

You rarely have to add extra code for baseline metadata—the system handles it. If you want metadata at unusual granularity or scale, or need non-JSON-compatible types, you may need to tweak your pipeline accordingly.

Let me know if you want code showing this end-to-end, or specifics for a database like Qdrant or pgvector!

# one of the selling points of Qdrant is it's disk use as vector and full text engine. how is that done in qdrant? is there support for this in cocoindex?

**Qdrant** achieves its reputation for efficient disk usage as both a vector and full-text engine by offering flexible storage models—**in-memory, memory-mapped (memmap), and on-disk (RocksDB) storage**—for both vectors and their associated “payload” (metadata or text). This enables scalable, search-efficient databases even for datasets that far exceed RAM capacity.

### How Qdrant Handles Disk-Based Storage

**1. Vectors (Embeddings) Storage:**

- **In-memory** storage keeps all vectors in RAM for fastest access—suitable for smaller datasets[^22_2][^22_3][^22_5].
- **Memmap (memory-mapped) storage** allows vectors to be stored on disk but mapped into virtual memory. OS page caching ensures efficient, scalable access, making it “almost as fast as in-memory” with enough RAM, but supporting much larger datasets. To enable, set `on_disk: true` when creating a collection[^22_2][^22_5][^22_8].
- *Advanced compression* and *quantization* features are available to further optimize storage and retrieval for huge vector sets[^22_4][^22_10].

**2. Payload (Metadata/Text) Storage:**

- **Payloads** are JSON objects (full text, metadata, etc.) attached to each vector.
- **InMemory payload** keeps all payload data in RAM for speed, reading/writing to disk only for persistence.
- **OnDisk payload** stores payloads directly in RocksDB—**massively reducing RAM requirements** for large or text-heavy datasets. Enable this using the `on_disk_payload` parameter when creating a collection[^22_1].
  + *Tip*: For queries filtering on payload fields, you can create a payload index for that field, which keeps its values in RAM and allows fast searches while the rest of the data stays on disk[^22_1].

**3. Versioning and Data Integrity**

- All changes are first written to a Write-Ahead Log (WAL) to guarantee durability and support safe recovery in case of failure. Data is then flushed into segments, with both vector and payload storage components per segment[^22_1][^22_5].

### Is this supported in CocoIndex?

**Yes, CocoIndex supports Qdrant’s on-disk and mixed storage modes.**

- **Collection creation options** in CocoIndex (and other modern vector frameworks) expose the underlying Qdrant configuration, including `on_disk` for vectors and `on_disk_payload` for payloads.
- When you configure an index/collection in CocoIndex, you can set these parameters, allowing it to:
  + Efficiently store both high-dimensional embeddings and large/complex metadata or text content directly on disk, not just in RAM.
  + Index and retrieve both the vectors and full-text metadata or payload fields for vector-plus-full-text retrieval and RAG workflows.
- **Payload-based filtering** and **advanced memory/disk balancing** work transparently with CocoIndex, leveraging Qdrant’s hybrid capabilities.

### Practical Qdrant Config Example (Python, applies to CocoIndex too)

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(url='http://localhost:6333')

client.create_collection(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
        size=768,
        distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
        on_disk=True           # Store vectors on disk (memmap)
    ),
    on_disk_payload=True        # Store payload on disk (RocksDB)
)
```

*In CocoIndex, you can pass the same collection options when configuring a Qdrant target or data sink.*

### Summary Table

| Storage Layer | Options | Backing Store | How It Works | Qdrant Support | CocoIndex Support |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Vectors (embeddings) | In-memory, Memmap | RAM, file on disk | RAM for speed, memmap to support large datasets | Yes | Yes |
| Payload (text/meta) | In-memory, OnDisk | RAM, RocksDB | On-disk storage for large text/fulltext payloads | Yes | Yes |

**In conclusion:**
Qdrant enables vector and full-text (payload) storage directly on disk, supporting huge and text-rich datasets with efficient search and minimal RAM. CocoIndex fully supports these Qdrant storage options; just set `on_disk` and/or `on_disk_payload` in your index configuration to leverage them[^22_1][^22_2][^22_3][^22_4][^22_5].

\*Community and research projects exist for GPU-accelerated Neo4j deployments[^23_1][^23_3].

## Notes on GPU Acceleration and Model Fit

- **Milvus** is unique for native GPU support; large-scale deployments can leverage CUDA for vector indexing/search[^23_2].
- **Qdrant**, **pgvector**, and **Weaviate** are exceptionally resource-efficient, but optimize for CPU+RAM (and disk for Qdrant).
- **Pinecone** and Milvus handle scaling/GPU automatically in SaaS/managed offering.
- Hybrid search (vector + full text/meta) is a major plus for code embeddings and RAG—Qdrant especially stands out for this[^23_4][^23_2].
- For *graph semantics* (e.g., GraphRAG), **Neo4j** and **Kuzu** offer first-class graph modeling; Qdrant and Weaviate are less focused in this area.
- All listed options support local or SaaS except Pinecone (SaaS only).

### When to Choose What

- **Qdrant:** Code/metadata search, hybrid retrieval, code-scale datasets, disk use crucial, easy deploy.
- **pgvector/Postgres:** Simpler cases, want a SQL base, small to mid-scale projects, integration with RDBMS/analytics.
- **Neo4j, Kuzu:** Rich graph tasks (call graphs, code dependency, GraphRAG), explore relationships.
- **Milvus:** Very large/high-performance workloads, GPU cluster, heavy ML workloads.
- **Weaviate/Pinecone:** Plug-and-play retrieval, SaaS scaling, fast prototyping, hybrid search.

**All of these systems support CocoIndex as vector/graph DB backends, with varying strengths around vectors, metadata, graph intelligence, and deployment flexibility[^23_4][^23_2][^23_1].**

# I mentioned special coding embeddings like CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and UnixCoder. Can you give a short overview a this field (include the one I just mentioned). Pro and Cons, GPU support, License modell?

Here’s a concise overview of the **specialized code embedding models** you mentioned—**CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and UniXcoder**—with major alternatives in this field included for comparison.

## Code Embedding Models: Overview

| Model | Key Idea/Method | Pros | Cons | GPU Support | License |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **CodeBERT** | Bimodal (code + NL) Transformer pre-trained on paired code-text (6 languages) | Strong base for code search, completion, summarization. Widely available/pretrained. | Structure-blind: does not use code graphs. | Yes (HF, PyTorch/TensorFlow) | MIT ([^24_4][^24_3]) |
| **GraphCodeBERT** | Adds data flow (semantic code graphs) to CodeBERT; trained with structure-aware tasks | Excels at tasks using code structure (code clone, translation, search); top results | Slightly slower, more memory use; limited to set languages | Yes (HF, PyTorch) | MIT ([^24_4][^24_5]) |
| **UniXcoder** | Unified cross-modal model; uses code, docstrings, and AST; supports more languages | State-of-the-art on many code2code, code search, and generation benchmarks | Heavier, more complex; HF model size large | Yes (HF, PyTorch) | MIT ([^24_3][^24_9][^24_10]) |
| **CodeT5 / CodeT5+** | Text-to-text transformer for code tasks; trained on code and text tasks | Flexible generation (summarization/search/completion); many variants | Some variants not as deeply structural | Yes | Apache 2.0 |
| **CodeBERTScore** | Evaluation metric using CodeBERT embeddings | Good for code generation eval, not direct embedding model | - | - | - |

### Brief Descriptions

**CodeBERT**

- First large bimodal model for code and natural language (NL); based on RoBERTa.
- Pre-trained on code-text pairs (*CodeSearchNet*; C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Go, JavaScript, PHP).
- Good general-purpose code/text semantic search and completion[^24_3][^24_4].

**GraphCodeBERT**

- Extension of CodeBERT that incorporates semantic **data flow graphs** during pre-training[^24_5].
- Uses code structure (variables, data flow) to encode relations between tokens—especially effective for code search, clone detection, translation, and code refinement, providing state-of-the-art performance[^24_1][^24_5].
- Slightly higher memory/computational requirement due to graph attention, but offers the best results on structure-aware tasks.

**UniXcoder**

- Unified cross-modal model: understands both code and (optionally) natural language via comments/docstrings and leverages the AST for richer code context[^24_3][^24_7][^24_9][^24_10].
- Excels at code2code retrieval, code translation, and generative tasks across more programming languages than CodeBERT/GraphCodeBERT—often top performer in benchmarks.
- Architecturally heavier, with larger model sizes; works well for more “multilingual” scenarios.

**CodeT5 / CodeT5+**

- Text-to-text transformer for code, enabling summarization, translation, search, and completion.
- Strong, flexible, open source; Apache 2.0 license.

## Model Comparison Table

| Model | Structure-aware | Main Languages* | Typical Use Cases | GPU Use | License |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| CodeBERT | No | 6 (C, C++, Java, etc.) | Search, summarization | Yes | MIT |
| GraphCodeBERT | Yes (data flow) | 6 | Clone detection, search, translation | Yes | MIT |
| UniXcoder | Yes (AST ± NL) | 10+ (C-like + more) | Cross-modal retrieval, translation, generative code NL/code | Yes | MIT |
| CodeT5 | Partial | Multi | Summarization, search, generation | Yes | Apache2 |

\*Languages vary slightly per model; see published docs for details.

## Key Points

- **GPU Support:** All major models run on GPU with HuggingFace, PyTorch, or TensorFlow—making them practical for production and research.
- **Licenses:** CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, and UniXcoder are under MIT; CodeT5 is Apache 2.0. All are open for research and most commercial use.
- **Pros \& Cons:**
  + *CodeBERT*—fast, multilingual, easy to use, but no graph awareness.
  + *GraphCodeBERT*—best for tasks where code structure/relations matter.
  + *UniXcoder*—covers most languages, best for rich cross-modal code+NL tasks, bigger resource/memory footprint.
  + *CodeT5*—very flexible, good for generative code/search, less "deep" structure than GraphCodeBERT.

**Summary:**

- For standard code search and indexing, **CodeBERT** is often sufficient and fast.
- If you need to leverage code structure (for code clone detection, code translation, or advanced code understanding), **GraphCodeBERT** often outperforms.
- For generative and multilingual/cross-modal (NL↔code/code↔code) tasks, **UniXcoder** or **CodeT5** are excellent choices.

# Ok. I see that I also need the supported languages. Is there anything for haskell as well? My main focus is: java, kotlin, scala, rust, go, ocaml, python, bash, shell, html, typescript, dart, css

Here's an **overview of code embedding models with an emphasis on language support**—including your list (**Java, Kotlin, Scala, Rust, Go, OCaml, Python, Bash/Shell, HTML, TypeScript, Dart, CSS**) and a focus on **whether Haskell is supported**, pros, cons, GPU, and license:

\* “Supported” = known/supported by pretraining data and/or evaluation in official model/paper.
† UniXcoder can be fine-tuned for Haskell; basic out-of-the-box support is limited, see below.
‡ OpenAI service handles GPU for you.

## **Notes on Your Focus Languages**

- **Java, Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, HTML, Bash/Shell, CSS, Dart:**
Modern generalist embedding models ([Jina Embeddings v2][^25_8], OpenAI, CodeR) and some specialist models (UniXcoder, CodeT5, GraphCodeBERT/CodeBERT) cover all these *except*:
  + **OCaml and Haskell** are not mainstream in existing massive code embedding models.
  + **Kotlin, Scala, Dart, CSS:** Limited or no explicit native support in older models; newer large multilingual models (Jina v2, CodeR) may support them to some degree via transfer learning or because they are related to supported languages.
- **Haskell:**
  + Recent research ([van Dam et al., 2024][^25_6]) shows general code LLMs (CodeGPT, UniXcoder) can be **fine-tuned for Haskell** and work “sufficiently well” for code completion; however, **base models often fail on functional code out of the box**—performance lags compared to Python/Java and high-quality datasets for fine-tuning are limited[^25_6].
  + There is **no major, widely-available pretrained code embedding model with explicit Haskell support out of the box** (like CodeBERT or GraphCodeBERT).
  + If you need Haskell embeddings:
    - Fine-tune existing generalist models (UniXcoder, CodeT5, CodeR) on Haskell-specific corpora (see the [HumanEval-Haskell dataset][^25_6]).
    - Consider OpenAI embeddings for general semantic search, but these may miss code-specific structure.
  + [Jina v2][^25_8] and similar embedding suites do *not* list Haskell in official support, but multilingual training means they might work on short snippets, just with lower performance.
  + See [CodeGPT and UniXcoder Haskell fine-tuning result discussion][^25_6].
- **OCaml:**
  + Rare in code embedding research; only large multilingual models (Jina Embeddings v2, possibly CodeR and OpenAI embeddings) might provide basic support, but not as a first-class target.
  + For **Kotlin, Scala, Dart, CSS:** coverage is uneven in specialist models, but much better in the largest recent “all-the-code” models (Jina v2, CodeR, OpenAI).

## **Summary Table: Your Languages vs. Model Support**

| Language | CodeBERT | GraphCodeBERT | UniXcoder | CodeT5 | CodeR | Jina v2 | OpenAI |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Java | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Kotlin | ❌ | ❌ | ❓ | ❌ | ❓ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Scala | ❌ | ❌ | ❓ | ❌ | ❓ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Rust | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Go | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| OCaml | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❓ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Python | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Bash/Shell | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❓ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| HTML | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

| CSS | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Haskell | ❌ | ❌ | (fine-tune) | ❌ | (❓) | (❌) | (general text) |

## Recommendations

- For **Java, Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, HTML, Bash, CSS, Dart**, use recent large multilingual models (**CodeR**, **Jina Embeddings v2**, **OpenAI Ada v2/3**).
- **UniXcoder**: fine-tune for Haskell if you have data; otherwise, expect limited out-of-the-box success.
- **CodeBERT/GraphCodeBERT**: strong for core C-style languages, not for functional/ML languages.
- For **OCaml, Haskell**: no “native” support—multilingual models or fine-tuning is needed.
- For best functional language coverage, **fine-tune** a general model yourself.

# OpenAI embeddings are SaaS? Or local? What license?

**OpenAI embeddings are available exclusively as a SaaS (cloud API) offering—there is no official local/on-prem download or self-hosted deployment**[^26_2][^26_3][^26_4][^26_8]. All embedding models (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002`) require you to send requests to OpenAI’s API or via providers like Azure OpenAI, which is also cloud-managed[^26_1][^26_4][^26_8].

- **Deployment:** SaaS only (no local, no open weights)
- **How to use:** You obtain embeddings by sending text/code to the OpenAI API endpoint; you cannot download or run the model locally[^26_2][^26_3][^26_4].
- **Licensing:** The OpenAI API is proprietary; usage is governed by OpenAI’s commercial terms of service and pricing (with some additional options via Azure)[^26_1][^26_3]. There is no open-source or permissive license for running the model yourself.

**Summary:**

- **OpenAI embeddings are SaaS/cloud-only, proprietary-license models.**
- **You cannot run OpenAI’s embedding models locally.**
- **Usage is billed as an API service.**[^26_2][^26_3][^26_4][^26_8]

# This is a scary result for my task as haskell is my main playing field at present. Is there anything I could to do without fine-tuning? There are many modells in sentence-transformer! Is one of them expecial useful? What do I need for fine-tuning as data? How complicated is it to fine-tune UniXcoder? Is this different from fine-tuning GraphCodeBERT or CodeR?

You have several practical options for meaningful Haskell code embeddings, even without your own fine-tuning:

### 1. **Using Pretrained Embeddings Without Fine-Tuning**

- **General text/code models like those in the [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/pretrained_models.html) (“SBERT”) family** can certainly be used to embed Haskell code or documentation as strings. Many users leverage models such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for semantic search on multi-language codebases[^27_5][^27_10][^27_2].
  + **Advantage:** Extremely easy to use, fast, supports GPU, huge model zoo (~15,000+), readily available from HuggingFace[^27_3][^27_6].
  + **Limitation:** These models are optimized for English and major programming languages (Python, Java, etc.). Performance on Haskell code is generally *usable for retrieval* but may lack deep code-specific structure understanding or language nuances.
- **Jina Embeddings v2 (e.g. `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code`)** have multilingual code support and can represent code in 30+ languages. While Haskell is not officially listed, you may get better results for general semantic retrieval than pure text models, and these are supported natively in SentenceTransformers starting from v2.3.0[^27_4].
- **INSTRUCTOR models** and other "generic instruction-following embedders" (e.g., `"hkunlp/instructor-large"`) are designed to handle diverse retrieval tasks, but again, their code awareness for Haskell can be limited unless they've seen similar data[^27_1].

#### *For usable out-of-the-box Haskell search, try:*

- `"all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` – very fast baseline[^27_2][^27_5][^27_10]
- `"jinaai/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code"` – for better code representation[^27_4]
- `"multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-dot-v1"` – for retrieval from code+docs[^27_1]

### 2. **Fine-tuning: When, Why, and How**

- **Do you need fine-tuning?**
  + If your use case is *exact code clone detection*, fine-grained code search, summarization, or anything requiring deep code semantic understanding (beyond surface similarity), *fine-tuning on Haskell code is strongly recommended*.
  + **Otherwise:** General SBERT or Jina models work “well enough” for simple retrieval and doc search.
- **What data do you need for fine-tuning?**
  + **Pairs of (Haskell code, description)**: For code search and doc-aware retrieval.
  + **Pairs of similar/dissimilar Haskell code snippets**: For code clone detection or semantic similarity tasks.
  + There are a few public Haskell code corpora (e.g., [HumanEval-Haskell], open source repositories), but you may need to scrape or mine your own examples from Github, Hackage, or your private codebase.
- **How hard is it?**
  + **For SentenceTransformers:** Fine-tuning is quite straightforward, especially if you have pairs/triplets. Example code is well-documented, and GPU is supported out-of-the-box[^27_3][^27_6][^27_7].
  + **For UniXcoder, GraphCodeBERT, CodeR:**
    - All support HuggingFace fine-tuning, but *setup is more complex* (tokenization, data preprocessing, larger models, usually longer epochs).
    - **UniXcoder:** Accepts code, optionally with docstrings or AST. You'd prepare datasets with your Haskell code and (optionally) comments; the finetune script and format are HuggingFace-standard.
    - **GraphCodeBERT:** Fine-tuning is similar, but data flow graphs (AST edges) boost results. For Haskell, you’d need tooling to extract such structure (Tree-sitter or GHC API output); so, more setup overhead.
    - **CodeR:** Same as above; easier for text/code tasks, more generic, but structure-aware capabilities depend on your dataset and pre/post-processing.
- **Fine-tuning effort (from easiest to hardest):**

1. **SentenceTransformers** (SBERT): Fastest, best docs, can use any code/text pairs, robust transfer learning, runs well on consumer GPU[^27_3][^27_6].
2. **Jina Embeddings:** Similar ecosystem/ease to SBERT (if you want to extend v2-base model yourself).
3. **UniXcoder/CodeR:** Requires HuggingFace trainer know-how, more data wrangling, higher VRAM.
4. **GraphCodeBERT:** Most work if you want to use AST/graph structure for Haskell, but possible.

### 3. **Summary Table: Options for Haskell Code Embedding**

| Approach | Out-of-the-box? | Structure-aware? | Specialized for Code? | Haskell-specific? | Ease of Use | Fine-tuning Support | GPU |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| SentenceTransformers (SBERT) | Yes | No | Medium | General | Easiest | Yes | Yes |
| Jina Embeddings v2 | Yes | No (some code) | High | Some (not listed) | Easy | Yes | Yes |
| UniXcoder (w/o finetune) | Sort-of | Yes | Very high | Needs finetune | Medium | Yes | Yes |
| GraphCodeBERT/CodeR (w/o finetune) | No | Yes | Very high | Needs finetune | Harder | Yes | Yes |
| OpenAI Embeddings | Yes (API) | No | Medium | General | Easy (API) | No | Yes |

### **Practical Advice**

- **Start with SBERT (SentenceTransformers) and/or Jina v2 Base Code, even for Haskell**: They are easy, fast to set up, and provide decent "semantic search" over code or combined code and documentation[^27_4][^27_5].
- If your Haskell tasks need higher accuracy or code structure understanding, **plan to collect Haskell code samples (and optionally docstrings) to fine-tune a code model**.
- **Fine-tuning UniXcoder/CodeR/GraphCodeBERT is not fundamentally different from one another:** All rely on HuggingFace standard Trainer setup, but structure-aware models will require more careful data processing if you want to leverage code structure or AST edges for Haskell.

#### **Data for Fine-tuning:**

- Source: own codebase, open source Haskell projects, [HumanEval-Haskell], scraped Github projects, docstrings.
- Format: code pairs, code+description, code+AST (optional for advanced models).
- **Volume:** Even a few thousand good-quality pairs can make a difference for retrieval or search tasks.

**In summary:**

- For zero-effort embeddings on Haskell, go with SBERT or Jina.
- For maximum relevance/semantic understanding, fine-tune (SBERT easiest, structure-aware models hardest).
- Fine-tuning requires pairs of Haskell code and, optionally, documentation.
